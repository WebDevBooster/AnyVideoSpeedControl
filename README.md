# AnyVideoSpeedControl

**Any Video Speed Control** is a browser extension to easily control the playback speed of any normal video (HTML5) on any website using keyboard. 

Press the plus (+) key to increase or the minus (-) key to decrease the playback speed of a video in 25% increments.

2 quick pushes on the plus key will increase the video speed to 1.5x and 6 pushes to 2.5x etc.

And yes, watching some videos at 2.5x and even at 3x speed is a viable thing to do. Your brain will adjust quickly to the higher speed and you'll still get all the information. Just that much faster. 

Pressing the multiply (*) key will set the speed back to normal. Hovering the mouse over the video will briefly display the current playback speed.
